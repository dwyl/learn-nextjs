```
npx create-next-app nextjs-blog --use-npm --example "https://github.com/vercel/next-learn-starter/tree/master/learn-starter"
```

That creates a bunch of files according to [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn)






## `tl;dr`

This isn't exactly _light_ on dependencies:

```
Installing packages. This might take a couple of minutes.
added 694 packages from 283 contributors
```

Installed `gray-matter`:

```
npm install gray-matter --save-dev
+ gray-matter@4.0.2
added 8 packages from 18 contributors and audited 702 packages in 4.221s

34 packages are looking for funding
  run `npm fund` for details

found 5 vulnerabilities (3 low, 1 moderate, 1 high)
  run `npm audit fix` to fix them, or `npm audit` for details
```

**1 high** ... unsurprising in **702** packages ...
