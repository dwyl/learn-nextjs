# Learn NextJS

npx create-next-app nextjs-blog --use-npm --example "https://github.com/vercel/next-learn-starter/tree/master/learn-starter"
```







## `tl;dr`

This isn't exactly _light_ on dependencies:

```
added 759 packages from 404 contributors and audited 759 packages in 20.486s

78 packages are looking for funding
  run `npm fund` for details

found 5 vulnerabilities (3 low, 1 moderate, 1 high)
  run `npm audit fix` to fix them, or `npm audit` for details
```

**1 high** priority vulnerability ... unsurprising in **759** packages from **404** contributors.
